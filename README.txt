This is software for the paper "Inference for stochastic kinetic models from multiple data sources for joint estimation of infection dynamics from aggregate reports and virological data" by Garcia, Chkrebtii, Capistran, and Noyola.

This demonstration is performed on simulated data. The appendix section of the paper provides information on how to obtain the real data used in the study.

Run MCMC.py to fit the model. MCMC samples will periodically be saved to the Output folder. Run Make_diagnostic_plots.py at any time to visualize the samples stored in the Output folder.
